### OSINT-Phone-Search-Tool-Mockup

## Description:

This page was inspired by Micheal Bazzell's Inteltechniques website (specifically the phone search tool). 
It was my final project for CS50's Introduction to Computer Science coursee from Harvard.
Of course it isn't a very good website, but if there any suggestions on how I can 
shorten my code or provide an easier solution to user responsive design, feel free
to tell me.
