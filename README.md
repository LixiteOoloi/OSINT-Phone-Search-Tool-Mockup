### OSINT-Phone-Search-Tool-Mockup

## Description:

This page was inspired by Micheal Bazzell's Inteltechniques website (specifically the phone search tool). 
It wasmy final project for CS50's Introduction to Computer Science courser from Harvard.
Of course it isn't a very good website, but if there any suggestions on how I can 
shorten my code or provide an easier solution to user responsive design, fell free
to tell me.

Thank you for reading.
